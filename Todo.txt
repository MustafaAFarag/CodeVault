I was thinking to let admin have the ability add / create or remove tags from users

there will be some default tags like the role tags ( verified - ordinary - admin - Owner ( super_adminn ) 

there will be tags automatically given by completing like daily/weekly tasks 

also another tags will be automatically given to the user with the most uploaded notes , to the user with the most average rated notes
any other ideas

Milestone Achievements: Tags for reaching specific milestones, such as a certain number of notes uploaded or a certain number of ratings given.

Activity-Based Tags: Tags based on user activity patterns, like "Early Bird" for users who are consistently active early in the day or "Night Owl" for those who are active late at night.

Expert Tags: Tags for users who are recognized as experts in specific subjects or fields based on their notes or ratings, such as "Math Expert" or "Programming Guru."

Peer Recognition: Tags given based on peer recognition or votes, like "Most Helpful" or "Best Note Giver," where other users can nominate or vote for their peers.

Supportive Tags: Tags for users who assist others frequently, like "Mentor" or "Helper," to recognize those who support the community
